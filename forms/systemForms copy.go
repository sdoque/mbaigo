// The "forms" package is designed to define structured schemas, known as "structs,"
// which represent the format and organization of documents intended for data exchange.
// These structs are utilized to create forms that are populated with data, acting as
// standardized payloads for transmission between different systems. This ensures that
// the data exchanged maintains a consistent structure, facilitating seamless
// integration and processing across system boundaries.

// Basic forms include the service registration and the service query forms.
