// Package "components" addresses the structures of the components that
// are aggregated to form Arrowhead compliant systems in a local cloud.
// An Arrowhead local cloud is a system of systems, which are made up of a husk
// (a.k.a. a shell) and a unit-asset (a.k.a. an asset or a thing). The husk runs on a device,
// and exposes the unit assets' functionalities as services.

// A asset cannot be defined in the module since it is what makes up unit-asset(s)
// But it is an interface that has to be implemented by every system's unit-asset
